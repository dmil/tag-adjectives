Helping a student identify all the adjectives in her article.

Code adapted from https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-part-of-speech-tags-with-nltk-and-spacy-42056fcd777e

`article.txt` has some example text from https://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/random045/2002031355.html

`tag-adjectives.py` reads `article.txt` and prodcues some nice HTML with the adjectives tagged.
